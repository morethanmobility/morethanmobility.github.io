				<h3>Movement and Mobility Designed for You</h3>
				<p>

					Everyone deserves to move without pain.  Through the Yoga Tune Up® classes you will begin to learn movements and access increased ranges of movement that your body has not been exposed to since birth.  I adjust positions and movements throughout the sequence to deepen your range of movement and access more range.				</p>
				<h3>Stability + Mobility = Healthier Joints</h3>
				<p>
					Mobility without strength can actually have its own drawbacks, so we focus on strength at end ranges to keep the joints flexible but also stable.  This allows you to not only reach the box overhead, but also lift and carry it.  			</p>
				<h3>Restorative Adjunct to Athletic training</h3>
				<p>
					Yoga Tune Up® Instruction is a great complement to your daily fitness routine as it will work with any type of athletic training and will increase your performance capacity.  By identifying and correcting imbalances and introducing more slide and glide for your muscle tissue, you will notice an improvement in your other training. </p>
