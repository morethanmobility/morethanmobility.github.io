Restorative & functional mobility - with Coach Eva Martens

Yoga Tune Up® Level 1 Certified Instructor <br>
Crossfit Mobility Certified<br>
NCCP Olympic Weightlifting Coach<br>

Since starting in the fitness business in 2006,  I have developed a passion for understanding human movement and how we can fix the issues that arise from training or the lack thereof.  I've had the opportunity to see people at all points along their journey to health and wellness.  Meeting clients that range from high-level athletes to someone struggling with the debilitating effects of lupus, and in all people,  I see how critical movement and mobility are in maintaining a high quality of life.  I do what I can to provide any training, equipment, and mobility knowledge I have to assist you on your own personal fitness journey.

My own fitness journey has been varied - starting from 7 years of doing #martialarts #taekwondo, then doing the standard gym #cardio thing, moving onto #Crossfit and finally finding my passion in #Olympic #Weightlifting. So I love to talk anything fitness related and I have no judgements on what your fitness passion is, as its all about finding your own way

And yes - I met and was trained by the #mobilityleopard himself #KellyStarrett  ﻿
